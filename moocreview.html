                    <p>MOOCs are, in my opinion anyway, one of the best possible uses for the internet. The ability to get an education in a detailed, specialised field from university-level teachers regardless of your previous education, and nearly regardless of your location or financial situation, is unquestionably fantastic.</p>
                    <p>The websites that provide access to these courses are becoming more and more prolific and advanced. I’ve spent some time looking at and studying with these sites, and I thought it might be useful to write up my reviews and recommendations.</p>
                    <p>I’m going to look at 5 sites, and talk about what they do well and what kind of learner they would suit. The sites are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Udacity</li>
                        <li>Coursera</li>
                        <li>Codecademy</li>
                        <li>The Khan Academy</li>
                        <li>Safari Books Online</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is worth noting that the majority of courses online at the moment are technical in nature, but there are growing numbers of humanities and arts subjects being covered. I’m striving to become some kind of web developer, so most of my insights are based around technical learning – hence Codecademy’s inclusion.</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <a href="https://www.udacity.com"><h2>Udacity</h2></a>
                    <p class="lead">Good for: Self-motivated learners, people who cannot commit to deadlines, application developers</p>
                    <p>Udacity focuses largely on tech learning, and have some very impressive contributors. Their Web Development course is presented by the founder of Reddit, Steve Huffman. Their Design of Computer Programs course is presented by Peter Norvig, Director of Research at Google and AI programmer for NASA.  They also have in-house trainers and presenters who are enjoyable to watch. </p>
                    <p>Their courses consist of videos, quizzes, documents and links to documentation, which you work through at your own pace. The standard free courses have no additional support, and no deadlines either, but they cover a lot of ground and they are generally really attentive to laying groundwork and then building more complex concepts onto it.</p>
                    <p>The interface is great – each course is broken up into lessons, which are subdivided into modules, which display in a customer interface which you can navigate through easily, and which swaps from a video frame to a document display to an in-browser editor as you require. Instructor notes add links and helpful hints for the quizzes.</p>
                    <p>Paid option: Like many MOOCs, Udacity has a paid option which gives you access to a bunch of extras. In this case, it’s called a Nanodegree, in which you are asked to complete a number of projects to prove essential skills for a specific career, for example Front-End Web Developer. The courses themselves are accessible outside of the nanodegree, but the projects not only go towards getting your certificate, they also build up into an impressive portfolio. There’s also a sophisticated forum setup, in-class chat widget, regular Office Hours via Google Hangouts, a G+ group and probably more.</p>  
                    <p>Udacity’s mobile application is really pretty good by the way, though you may need to zoom in a bit to select individual buttons during some quizzes.</p>
                    <p>Cost: $200 per month, and you can complete the course as quickly as you like. If you miss a deadline for a project  you roll over into the next cohort (there’s one per month). 7 day free trial available.</p>
                    <a href="https://www.coursera.org"><h2>Coursera</h2></a>
                    <p class="lead">Good for: People motivated by deadlines/classroom environments, foreign language students</p>
                    <p>Coursera is one of the earliest MOOC sites to work with universities to provide their content. They host some of the most lauded courses from institutions all around the world. They try to provide a good selection of international courses, and subtitle in various languages as much as possible. </p>
                    <p>The website provides a platform for universities to present their own courses, which means that the style of the course varies considerably. It also means that you can find a huge variety of course types in Coursera. They cover programming as you’d expect, but they also reach into medicine, public speaking, history, finance, all sorts.</p>
                    <p>Courses consist of video lectures and quizzes, plus projects which can take all sorts of forms. My own examples have been programs which were submitted and then peer-assessed, and full-on exam papers which were graded automatically.</p>
                    <p>Coursera also has a nice mobile app, that lets you download the videos and watch them at a later time. There’s also some pretty reasonable unofficial apps, since Coursera were a little slow in bringing theirs out in the beginning.</p>
                    <p>Paid Option: All courses on Coursera are free, but you can pay extra to join Siganture Track, which gives you a verified certificate at the end. The deadline for signing up to Signature track is a week or two into the course, so you can find out if it suits you before you commit.</p>
                    <p>Cost: Varies</p>
                    <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/"><h2>Codecademy</h2></a>
                    <p class="lead">Good for: Coding beginners, people who learn by doing, web developers</p>
                    <p>Codecademy is really made by its neat interface. The site specialises in teaching coding languages, and it does so by having a really nice in-browser editor and interpreter, so you are constantly writing and running your code as you go along. The site covers HTML/CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Python, Ruby and PHP. You’ll get a good grounding in the basics of any of these, plus, you may notice that these are the fundamental requirements for becoming a web developer, so it’s pretty vocational.</p>
                    <p>Codecademy offers a limited selection of courses and projects, but the focus of the site is squarely on Wed Development skills, so there’s also a series of API courses. These generally use Ruby (Ruby on Rails is a really popular web framework)</p>
                    <p>Paid Option: None. Just go log in and start learning already!</p>
                    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"><h2>The Khan Academy</h2></a>
                    <p class="lead">Good for: revising school learning, curious people</p>
                    <p>This site has been something of a phenomenon. It began when Sal Khan started making Youtube videos to help his cousins with their school work, but Sal soon discovered that his cousins’ schoolmates were using them too. Since then, he’s developed the whole concept of learning at home to the point where there are a few schools that have reversed the usual pattern, sending the kids home to do the schooling, and doing homework together in class!</p>
                    <p>The Khan Academy site has a large portion of it which is focused on school-level learning, but it has been branching out into more advanced topics, including economics, arts and humanities and yes, some programming as well. A lot of people find value in the Khan Academy from all them to revisit school-level topics they haven’t used in a long time.</p>
                    <p>Another thing the Academy has done is build links with a lot of institutions, so for example they host a series of 2 minute talks by curators of the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and a guide to the solar system in association with NASA.</p>
                    <p>Paid Option: None, it’s all free. But be warned, there’s a levelling up process which might drag you in (just like it’s supposed to!)</p>
                    <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/"><h2>Safari Books Online</h2></a>
<p class="lead">Good for: Students who need textbooks, Developers looking for reference materials</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of Safari, in no small part due to the free licences we have at work, but I've learned more about linux from the video series on Safari than I have from anywhere else.</p>
<p>Safari is a library, a selection of high quality, often expensive, textbooks available for a moderate monthly fee. They have every O'Reilly book, which means they cover a LOT of ground, plus thousands more.</p>
<p>The mobile app is actually what really sold Safari to me, though looking at the website they may be in a period of transition, since they're saying there isn't an android app at the moment. Shame.</p>
<p>Paid Option: safari is entirely paid, aside from a 10-day free trial. If you can convince your company to invest in them, they do bulk and enterprise discounts.</p>
<p>Cost: $39/month for an individual, or $399 for a year. Used to have a cheaper option, seems to be gone.</p>
